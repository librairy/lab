<h2>Self-Organized sorting around radioactive particles</h2>
By Carlos Badenes
</table>
<p>Exist some particles, e.g. radioactive particles, that must be isolated to avoid propagate their effects.</p>
<p>Inspired by the biological phenomena of <i>chemotaxis</i> and the distribution model of gas particles
  a new algorithm is proposed to self-organize radioactive particles.</p>
<p>Two types of agents are initially randomly placed in a toroidal environment, one of them emit radiation
  and the other one try to isolate them. </p>
<p>These agents self-organise into a complex aggregate consisting of a group of radioactive agents
  surrounded by insulating agents. This paper describes the self-organized sorting algorithm.</p>
